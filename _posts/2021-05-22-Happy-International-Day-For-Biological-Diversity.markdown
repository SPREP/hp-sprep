‘***We are part of the solution’\*** is the theme for this year’s International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB) celebrated on 22 May each year. The special day serves to remind us that our biodiversity is the foundation upon which we can always build back better. 

We are part of the solution.

As we learn from the [Digital State of Environment and Conservation in the Pacific Islands: 2020 Regional Report](https://soec.sprep.org/report_online.html) - caring for nature is part of the Pacific way of life.  Our Pacific Leaders have endorsed regional and national priorities for protecting and managing the Pacific environment and its diverse ecosystems and for improving our relationship with nature.

To help keep up our momentum the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme have worked with our Members to enhance this. In 2020 the [10th Pacific Islands Conference on Nature Conservation and Protected Areas](https://www.pacificnatureconference.com/) was held which resulted in the [Vemööre Declaration: Commitments to nature conservation action in the Pacific Islands region, 2021-2025.](https://www.sprep.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/declaration-Vermoore-endorsed-2020-eng.pdf) Also launched was the [State of Environment and Conservation in the Pacific Islands: 2020 Regional Report](https://pacific-data.sprep.org/dataset/state-environment-and-conservation-pacific-islands-2020-regional-report) for which the digital version was launched this year.

> “Parallel to our digital reports and factsheets, we’re exploring different ways to reach a wide range of different audiences across our Pacific islands region to foster caring and nurturing of our environment. This includes activities that ‘edutain’ such as our online Pacific Biodiversity Quiz,” said Ms Nanette Woonton, SPREP’s Acting Communications and Outreach Adviser.

SPREP invites you to commemorate IDB 2021 by participating in the second quiz of our series called, ‘Pacific Biodiversity Quiz’.

SPREP launched its 2021 Quiz Series in April to commemorate Earth Day, which saw over 450 participants. The second quiz of the series titled ‘Pacific Biodiversity Quiz’ is launched today in commemoration of International Day of Biodiversity.

> “The quiz series is designed to grow interest and learning from children and adults alike through a virtual, fun, and interactive way – and we’ve found these to be really popular,” said Ms Angelica Salele-Sefo, SPREP’s Outreach Officer.

> “To learn and test their knowledge about our Pacific environment.  The quizzes are ten questions long and feature a different topic each month, released every to coincide and commemorate important environmental days or SPREP events.”
