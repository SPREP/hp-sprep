### How do I use GBIF to find data?
<br>The site [www.gbif.org](https://www.gbif.org) contains over one billion records of species, specimens, observations, and
samples. Each record will have information about how to download and cite the data. Try exploring
the site!
Start by searching from the homepage or clicking on “Get Data” in the top panel. You can look for
occurrence data, search by species, look for whole datasets, and more.

You can search for whole datasets using keywords. In this example, we’re looking for datasets with
titles that include “invasive”. (Note that you might not find all the data available about invasive
species this way. You will only find datasets that have been labelled using that exact word.)

You can search for datasets by region, called “Publishing country or area” in the left panel. You can
search for multiple countries at a time and combine with other filters: each checked box will be
included in your search.

For those of us in the Pacific, a useful way to find related datasets from our region is to look at the
datasets hosted by the SPREP Node. Here, we searched using “Secretariat of the Pacific Regional
Environment Programme” as the Host. There were 52 results at the time, and this number is
growing as you and your colleagues publish more data!

Click on a dataset name to find out more. You can also download the whole dataset if you want, in
a few different formats:

There are many ways to search, using filters, keywords, and more. One of the most common ways
to search is for a single species, and you can use either the scientific name (Latin name) or the
common name (vernacular) to search. However, it is important to remember that the vernacular
name might be different in different places, or the same name might be used for different species.
For example, here is a search for “crown of thorns”. The search results include the sea star or starfish
called “crown of thorns” but also include a plant, a fish, an insect, and more. For best results, you
may want to search a few times using different names.

You can also choose to search “everything” (occurrences, species, whole datasets, and more) by
entering a search, then clicking on the top left arrow here:
