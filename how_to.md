How do I use GBIF to find data?
The site [www.gbif.org](https://www.gbif.org) contains over one billion records of species, specimens, observations, and
samples. Each record will have information about how to download and cite the data. Try exploring
the site!
Start by searching from the homepage or clicking on “Get Data” in the top panel. You can look for
occurrence data, search by species, look for whole datasets, and more.
