#About us
The Pacific portal is to present all of the occurence biodiversity data currrently available on Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) from the following Pacific Island Countries and territories:
American Samoa, Cook Islands, East Timor, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Calendonia, Niue, Northern Marianas, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis & Futuna.

These customizable portals is focused on a regional level, and will be fully hosted by the GBIF Secretariat. They will provide advanced occurrence data search, browse, map visualization and image gallery capabilities similar to that of GBIF.org, scoped to a relevant defined subset of GBIF-mediated data. 
GBIF Participant nodes play an important role in promoting the use of biodiversity data mobilized by the GBIF network, which can involve maintaining national, institutional, regional or thematic biodiversity data portals. Responding to requests to lower the technical threshold for participation in GBIF, the Secretariat is developing simple, customizable biodiversity data portals to be offered as a fully hosted service to support user communities. The Secretariat is now seeking interested GBIF Participant nodes to collaborate in a pilot phase, for a minimum of 1 year, for these GBIF hosted portals.

**What the hosted portal can offer?**

Currently, the hosted portals available for pilot can offer:
* A place for GBIF nodes and data mobilization partners to describe themselves, their team or network, and activities (editable narrative text).
* Ability to provide simple branding (colour scheme, font and logos).
Ability to change language of the user interface (translations and languages other than English need to be provided by the community).
* Advanced occurrence data search, browse, map visualization and image gallery capabilities similar to that of GBIF.org (see note below). The results will be scoped to include a relevant defined subset of GBIF-mediated data (e.g. all data mobilized by a thematic network, or published by organizations within a country). Only public data published and indexed in GBIF will be available for search and to the same data quality control and taxonomic backbone as GBIF.org.
* A redirect from search results, sending users to GBIF.org for data downloads, ensuring that the downloads receive GBIF’s citable unique identifiers (DOIs) linking back to the datasets included.

**What is GBIF?**

*GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth.*
