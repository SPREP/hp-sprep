description: The Pacific portal is to present all of the occurence biodiversity data currrently available on Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) from the following Pacific Island Countries and territories:
American Samoa, Cook Islands, East Timor, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Calendonia, Niue, Northern Marianas, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis & Futuna.

These customizable portals is focused on a regional level, and will be fully hosted by the GBIF Secretariat. They will provide advanced occurrence data search, browse, map visualization and image gallery capabilities similar to that of GBIF.org, scoped to a relevant defined subset of GBIF-mediated data. 
GBIF Participant nodes play an important role in promoting the use of biodiversity data mobilized by the GBIF network, which can involve maintaining national, institutional, regional or thematic biodiversity data portals. Responding to requests to lower the technical threshold for participation in GBIF, the Secretariat is developing simple, customizable biodiversity data portals to be offered as a fully hosted service to support user communities. The Secretariat is now seeking interested GBIF Participant nodes to collaborate in a pilot phase, for a minimum of 1 year, for these GBIF hosted portals.
